# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict which Titanic passengers survived. It shows the complete data science process, starting from cleaning the data to evaluating the model.

# 🎯 Objective

Predict the survival of passengers based on various features like age, gender, fare, and class using classification models.
